# Colour Madness

Colour Madness a school exercise created by ROC Mondriaan, worked out by me. This was done for the minor Agile Game Production of the study Software Development. I was given the exercise to build a prototype of a game in a game engine I'd prefer, for this I have chosen PhaserJS, as I wanted to delve in deeper into JavaScript.
